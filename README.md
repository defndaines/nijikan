# nijikan

A Clojure library for evolving a modified game of life logic against a
2-dimensional grid.

## Usage

The functions are exposed from the `nijikan.core` namespace, but the primary
function for evolving a grid over unknown generations is `run`, which returns
a lazy sequence of generations starting with the first.

```
(nijikan/run [[0 0 0]
              [2 0 2]
              [0 0 0]])
```
